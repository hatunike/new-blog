Back in August 2015, I reviewed a new action camera on the market - the Garmin VIRB XE. I really liked it, and sold my GoPro cameras in favour of it. Since then, several software updates have come along, changing the experience  quite a lot â€” particularly if you use the data recording and display features. 

As such, I've updated my review to reflect what the camera is like in early 2016. Spoiler: It's better!
