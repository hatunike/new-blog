Hello! My name is Daniel Kennett, and this is my website. 

Before we get started, here's some tidbits about me to break the ice:

- I program things for a living. Normally it's on Apple platforms, but I've been known to dabble in C#.

- I love cars, and firmly believe that the *one true way* is an engine in the front, drive at the back and a nice manual gearbox in between. 

- I really enjoy photography.

- I'm still coming to terms with the fact that while I still tell people my favourite band is [Counting Crows](http://countingcrows.com), I *really* enjoy Taylor Swift's music.

- The first album I ever bought was the self-titled *B\*Witched*. 

- When asked to describe me in one sentence, my friend Tim replied: \\
       *"Nerdy. Doesn't eat his vegetables."*

### Education

I grew up in a tiny hamlet called Ogston in Derbyshire, England. The computing education in my local schools pretty much stopped at word processing, but one day when I was about 10 years old, I found a Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2A at a local car boot sale. It was already years out-of-date, but I loved typing in BASIC from the magazines and books that came with it. I was hooked! 

I started teaching myself "real" programming, and after a few false starts with Java I figured out [REALbasic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REALbasic) and started releasing my own little apps for Mac OS 9, including a very basic word processor and a couple of remote controls for the media players at the time.

*Writer, my first "real" application, was released in 2002.*

The first formal computing education I received was at the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield, England. In my final year, I learned Objective-C by writing an application that combined video and telemetry data recorded from a car, providing a live canvas to build graphical displays of the data.

During the project, I learned a lot about Objective-C programming, as well as video encoding with QuickTime. The application had a live canvas that you could edit while the video was playing, which I'm still pretty proud about considering this was before the days of Core Animation.

While the project was very educational and I of course took it seriously, it did provide a *wonderful* excuse to go and play on some closed courses - all in the name of data collection, of course.

*This photo got published in a UK magazine, erroneously crediting me as the photographer - something that the actual photographer doesn't let me forget to this day. "It's pretty amazing that you managed to drive the car and take that photo at the same time!"*

I graduated university in 2007 with a First Class degree in Computer Science.

### KennettNet Software Limited

Right out of university I started an indie business selling my own software for Mac and Windows. The business was successful for several years, and at its peak employed four people.

Our main product was an application called *Music Rescue* that pulled music and playlists back from iPods to a computer, but we had a few other little products too.

*Some of KennettNet's applications: Music Rescue, GeoCachr, GPS Logger and Clarus.*

Ultimately, KennettNet failed because I tried to expand our product line too much after our core product was successful, spreading our resources too thinly. In 2010 the company was effectively dead, and it was wound up in 2012.

In 2010, I moved to Sweden with my fiance√©.
